🚗 CarDekho Dataset - Price Prediction 📖 About the Dataset The CarDekho Dataset from Kaggle contains detailed information about used cars, including their brand, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, seller type, and several other features. 🛣️🚙

The primary objective of this dataset is to predict the selling price of a used car based on its features. This dataset is perfect for practicing regression tasks and understanding how different factors influence car prices in the Indian market. 🇮🇳

🎯 Objective Goal: Build machine learning models to accurately predict the selling price of used cars using various regression techniques.

🛠️ What I Did ✅ Performed Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover relationships between features

🏷️ Encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility

⚖️ Handled missing values and outliers where necessary

📈 Tried multiple algorithms to find the best fit for the data:

📐 Linear Regression

🔵 Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)

🔴 Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)

📍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🌳 Decision Tree Regressor

🌲 Random Forest Regressor

🏆 Result: Random Forest performed the best ✅, giving the most accurate predictions due to its ability to handle non-linearity and feature interactions efficiently.

📌 Key Learnings Regularized models like Ridge and Lasso helped reduce overfitting but didn’t outperform tree-based models.

Decision Trees provided interpretability, but suffered from overfitting alone.

Random Forest provided the best balance between bias and variance, handling categorical variables and capturing complex patterns in the data.

About
This project aims to predict the selling prices of used cars using the CarDekho Dataset from Kaggle. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying multiple regression algorithms to find the best-performing model.
